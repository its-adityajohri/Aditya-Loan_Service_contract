# Aditya Loan service contract
In this loan service i have created 4 classes and used all concepts of OOP
first lender and borrower information is to be stored in respective class objects. then objects for service class for borrowers and lenders will be made , function of the various functions in Service class are mentioned in comments 
data of borrowers is saved in 2D list.



The Loaning service system is a Centralized system as because here a central authority acts as a third party between the 2 parties (Lender and Borrower) involved in the task (Loan Service). Our loaning service acts as a Centralized mediator between the 2 parties, holding all the user and transactional information and carrying out the process.
Demerits of Centralized System ---
1)	Concentration of power and authority – A single central entity has all the power, takes all the decisions and decides the implementation. This leads to lack of control for other parties and lower hierarchies involved and restricts new idea implementation.
2)	Confidentiality Vulnerability – Confidentiality of data requiring secrecy is very vulnerable as all user information and task implementation information are held by the centralized authority, which if compromised, all information and data becomes invalid.
3)	The Central authority has all the decision making and initiative task which causes less innovation due to overload of work and less adaptability to new ideas by other non-power holding subordinates of the system.
